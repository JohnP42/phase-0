<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

	It felt pretty natural, a little mundane to just copy someone elses site.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

	Still learning, looking forward to knowing everything html5 can do

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

	I think it is ok. It validated for the most part.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

	Html is super easy, but there is not much that can be done on it's own

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

	For the most part the tags are pretty self explanitory.

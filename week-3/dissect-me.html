    <h2>Version Control and GitHub</h2>
    <h4>9/22/2015</h4>

    <p>
        I believe that an introduction is in order. My name is John Polhill. I am 20 years old currently living in Aurora IL and, like many of you that are reading this post, this is my first week of phase 0 in Dev Bootcamp. So, with that out of the way I will introduce the first topic. What are the benefits of version control? Well, I personally have not found version control to be very useful for the projects I would normally work on; however, that is only because I am a hobbyist when it comes to programming and all the work I do is solo and for fun.

         So, I have yet the need to keep record of my progress on a project. I do believe that when working on larger, team oriented projects that the benefits of using version control would increase exponentially. Having the ability to record the work of multiple parties and manage which of those works are accepted would be a huge boon to organization and productivity. As such, I am very certain that version control will become very beneficial for me in the future.

<!--
	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	We used header, nav, main, article, aside, and footer, and will continue to use each often because they seem to describe some of the fundimentals of a website. Specifically header, main, and footer, as these divide the page into 3 intuitive areas. Also, the section tag is also important do further divide the page.

	How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	The elements are laid out from top to bottom in the order that they are written. The browser displays the elements from top to bottom.

	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	I learned how to make snippets, and I do think it is very likely hat I will be creating more snippets. Also, shorcuts are very handy to improve productivity and I will try to become more familiar with them.

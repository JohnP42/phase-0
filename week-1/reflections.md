# 1.1 Think About Time 

The most useful time management and productivity I learned of through this research would be:

Start small, it will keep you from getting overwhelmed.
Get motivated, it is much easier when you want to do something.
Set milestones, this will give break points to review your work. 
Take breaks. If you end up stressed then it will just get harder.
Time boxing is a method of using time intervals as milestones. For instance, the Pomodoro technique has one work for 25 minutes with 5 minutes of rest and review in between. This breaks up the work into smaller fragments, which will make the whole project appear smaller. This same idea can be applied to phase 0. Break the work into smaller fragments and organize it through out your week. This is actually closest to the methods I use when managing my time, and I would say it works fairly well. Although, wanting to do something makes the task immensely easier, so finding a way to get motivated also helps.

For phase 0, essentially I plan to Time Box the work I'm given; however, I find that I am extremely motivated to do the work in phase 0 as programming is my passion. So, I'll probably end up doing more than my allotted time box. 

# 1.2 The Command Line

A shell is essentially a user interface of an OS. So, the shell is what you see, it's the outside. While bash is a particular shell for Unix. The most difficult part of learning the command line is the amount of memorization and knowing when to apply certain commands. However, I successfully managed to use all the listed commands. The most important commands I found were pwd, ls, cd, and help. The first 3 are essential for navigation, while the help command is there incase you forget a certain command.


-pwd: prints the current working directory.

-ls: lists all directories and files in current directory.

-mv: moves or renames a file from one directory to another.

-cd: changes the current directory.

-../: the directory above the current directory.

-touch: creates a file.

-mkdir: makes a new directory.

-less: views a file.

-rmdir: removes a directory.

-rm: removes a file.

-help: tells what commands do.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

To create a new repo:

*navigate to your GitHub account.
*click the repositories tab.
*click new.
*name the new repository and adjust an options.
*click create.

To fork a repo:

*navigate to a repository you wish to fork from GitHub.
*click the fork button at the top right.
*click the profile you wish to fork to.
*profit.

To clone a repo:

*navigate to a repository you wish to clone from GitHub.
*look for the HTTPS clone url and copy that.
*open your command line.
*navigate to the directory you with to clone it to
*type: git clone (paste url with on parenthesis)
*hit enter.
 

You would fork a repository if you wanted to make changes to that repository without altering the original. As opposed to creating a new one, which would be if you wanted to start a whole new repository.

The struggle I had was actually a little bit unrelated, as I went on a tangent trying to figure out how to open Sublime Text through vagrant ssh.

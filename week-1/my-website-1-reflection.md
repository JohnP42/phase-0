###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source is cool, it allows for communities to get togeather to build on each other's work.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses give permission to the general public as to what they are allowed to do with your work. So, if don't care what they do with it then you put a license for that such as MIT, but if you don't want people to sell it you would use a different license, such as creative commons.

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

By this challenge I was pretty familier with creating and cloning repositories, however it did clear up licenses for me. The only problem is my inability to open Sublim through Git Bash, due to having to use a virtual machine.

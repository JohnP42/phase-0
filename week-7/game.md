####What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
Deciding on what game to make, and if I should create my own assets or not. Also, Javascript doesn't allow classes to be used on websites, so figured out halfway through that the function Name(args) {} basically works like classes made things kinda messy. Also, first reall time using javascript, so just learning as I went made things even messier.

####What did you learn about creating objects and functions that interact with one another?
Inheritance sucks in Javascript, at least with what I know ofi so far. Also, treat objects like nouns, and functions like actions that the objects can take.


####Did you learn about any new built-in methods you could use in your refactored solution? If so, what were they and how do they work?
I didn't learn of any new built in methods, and I didn't really try to hard with refactoring. I think I'd rather start a new project and keep it clean from the begining and refactor as I go rather than all at the end, at least with a largeish project.

####How can you access and manipulate properties of objects?
It seems as if javascript instance variables are by default public, so I just used dot notation to access and manipulate them.

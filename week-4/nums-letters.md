#####What does puts do?

puts will output a string to the terminal. For instancee, puts 5+5 will output "10", and puts "ten" will output "10".

#####What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a positive or negative whole number, including 0. A float is a floating point number, or a decimal either posotive or negative.

#####What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Dividing an integer will eschew the decimals when dividing, resulting in a rounded down value. For instance, 9 / 2 will yield 4 as an integer rather than 4.5, which would be the float. But, be careful when comparing divided floats, as floats won't always be perfect when devided. For instance, that 4.5 could be 4.50000000001, this is because the computer uses a binary floating-point which doesn't easily portray numbers like 4.5.

'''ruby
puts 365*24 #Hours in a year

puts 10*365*24*60 #Minutes in a decade

#####How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

It handles it like a calculator, using +, -, *, and / for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectivly.

#####What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

a string is an array of characters, one would use them for when one would want to store or display text. A string can be indentified by a pair of "" or ''.

#####What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

local variables are those that are specific to where the variable is declared. For instance, a variable declared inside a method can only be used within that method.

#####How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

It was good, it gave a nice overview of the basics of ruby and how to use terminal and rspec to test ruby code.
